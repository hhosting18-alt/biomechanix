# Biomechanix landing page

Open `index.html` in a browser (or upload the whole folder to any static host).

## Structure
- `index.html` — the full page (HTML, CSS and JS in one file)
- `assets/img/` — PLACEHOLDER photos, to be replaced before launch

## 3D athlete
The hero and the "how it works" tabs use a rigged 3D character: `assets/models/athlete.glb`
(a free three.js sample character, PLACEHOLDER). Swap in your own Mixamo character by
replacing that file with a `.glb` using the standard Mixamo skeleton (bone names `mixamorig:*`).
The 3D only loads over http(s) (GitHub Pages, or `python3 -m http.server` locally).
Opened straight from disk, the page falls back to the flat 2D figure.

## Replace before going live
1. **3D character** — `assets/models/athlete.glb` (see above).
2. **Photos** — every file in `assets/img/` is a temporary placeholder.
   Keep the same file names and they drop straight in:
   hero-runner, path-training, path-rehab, path-self-assessment, path-enterprise,
   fitness-banner, physio-banner, sameeksha-banner, team-gaurav, team-raghunandan,
   partners-banner, footer-photo (.webp).
3. **App store links** — "Get it on Google Play" buttons currently use `href="#"`.
4. **Support / Privacy Policy links** — currently `#support` and `#privacy-policy`.
